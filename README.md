  To-be updated.  Summary: For this project, I helped another graduate student conduct a Specification Curve Analysis (SCA) to predict votes in the 2016 presdidential election, support or endorsement of authoritarian attitudes/ideas, support for democracy, and endorsement of different childrearing choices from social and news media variables while accounting for personality variables and several demographics. In total there were more than 192,000 models executed.  Additionally, all the models in this implementation of SCA were cross-validated. 

Note: While the script will run succesffully, I would not recommend this approach. I wrote it quickly and early in my graduate studies.  The script is very 'fragile' in the sense that it is designed in a way that it must run to completion without error to provide results.
